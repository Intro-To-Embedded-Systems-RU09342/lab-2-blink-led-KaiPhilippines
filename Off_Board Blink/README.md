# Off Board Blink
In this lab, the G2553 is taken off the development board and is placed into a breadboard to blink two LEDs with different rates. 

# Implementation
Much of the code used in this lab is from the Multiple Blink LED lab. The watchdog timer is disabled. The if statements are in the while loop with count incrementing and reseting. As seen in the gif, resistors are used and the LEDs used are blinking at different rates, similar to the LEDs in the multiple blink, with one of the LED blinking twice as fast as the other LED.
